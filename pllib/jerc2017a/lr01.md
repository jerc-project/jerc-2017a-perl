# Package: jerc2017a::lr01

### Function: bsc
This function is a copy of __chobakwrap__'s __wraprg::bsc__ function.
It is noodled in here, rather than merely referenced, so that this
library can (if necessary) run independently of the __chobakwrap__
infrastructure.

### Function: safety
This function is a wrapper for the __decode\_json__ function. It allows the parsing
of JSON strings without bringing down the whole program in the event of a failure.
However, despite the fact that it is a safety wrapper, it's interface differs
from that of the function it wraps.

This function has two arguments.
The first argument is the JSON string that needs to be parsed.
The second argument is where this function places the return value of
__decode\_json__ - but this argument will remain untouched in
the event of the function's falure, which makes the starting-value
of theis argument the effective default-value.

The return value of this function is _true_ in the event of success
and _false_ in the event of failure.
